## Description

This is a book search engine created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and Graphql. You can search for a book, create an account, and save books to your account. 

## Technologies

This site was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and Graphql.

## Install

2. Open in code editior (I used VS Code).
3. Open a new instance of the integrated terminal.
4. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.
5. Run ```npm run develop``` to start the application.
6. If the site doesn't open automatically, navigate to ```https://localhost:3000/```
